# Tip-Calculator

In order to build a tip calculator, we would use three different programming languages, viz â€“ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The importance of each of the language is specified below:

#HTML: 

HTML is used to create a layout of tip calculator. HTML forms the basics of the project and specifies its parameters.

#CSS:

The next step in the process is CSS which helps in making the calculator more presentable and attractive for better outlook.

#JS: 

The last step in the process will be giving the calculator a logical implementation which would be done using JavaScript.
