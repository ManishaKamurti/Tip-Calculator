# Tip-Calculator

In order to build a tip calculator, we would use three different programming languages, viz â€“ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The importance of each of the language is specified below:

#HTML: https://github.com/ManishaKamurti/Tip-Calculator/blob/0982a33da26d86e2591d2679a525eaaf5cb025ea/ht.html

HTML is used to create a layout of tip calculator. HTML forms the basics of the project and specifies its parameters.


#CSS: https://github.com/ManishaKamurti/Tip-Calculator/blob/96e2e34cfc4534b46590ff02116e75b6f7482ebf/margin.css

The next step in the process is CSS which helps in making the calculator more presentable and attractive for better outlook.


#JS: https://github.com/ManishaKamurti/Tip-Calculator/blob/96e2e34cfc4534b46590ff02116e75b6f7482ebf/window.js

The last step in the process will be giving the calculator a logical implementation which would be done using JavaScript.
